# postbox-finder

This is a "chatbox"-style app that sends users the location of their nearest postbox using Facebook Messenger and the Nexmo Messages API.

It was featured in the [Christmas Card Dash: Find Your Nearest Postbox](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2018/12/06/nearest-postbox-with-node-js-nexmo-messages-api-dr/) blog post and all the instructions for getting started with the application can be found there.
